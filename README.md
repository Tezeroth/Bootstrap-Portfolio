## Bootstrap-Portfolio


## The acceptance criteria for this project are:

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

# A navigation bar - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML

- for this task, I used a standard bootstrap nav bar and edited the colors and components.
  
- I included links that are applicable to my portfolio, such as a link to my resume, and anchor points on the page



 # A hero section - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

 - I completed the above tasks using a standard jumbotron. I took out the code for the button and added an image in the HTML with border radius at 50%

    # A work section

-  For this section, I displayed some old work I did in Sketch Fab using bootstrap cards in a grid. When the pictures are clicked on they either open a bigger picture or go through to an external website. I gave the work a brief description, and hopefully, when we complete more projects I will add more.

    # A skills section

- I a card stretched over 2 columns I wrote down the skills I expected to learn from the boot camp

    # An about/contact section
- I borrowed some bootstrap code from: https://bootstrapbrain.com/component/bootstrap-5-minimal-about-me-section/#code, where I changed the background color. and did a CSS override on the button for it to display a drop shadow.

    # A footer section
- I had difficulties with the footer section, trying to get it to display icons. I will come back to this.

    # Your Bootstrap solution should minimize the use of media queries.
  
- This website doesn't use any media queries as far as I am aware

Things I learned in completing this project - there is a difference between: 'link rel' and 'link href'
